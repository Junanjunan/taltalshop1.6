    I have tried all .ebextensions method of adding implementation level configuration and it didn't helped me in the latest Amazon Linux AMI. I have did a lot research and after going through the logs i can find the deployment task runner is checking for a folder called .platform everytime and i thought of add one just like the .ebextensions. Below is the settings i have done in my root folder of my project.

    Add the below folder setup in the root level of your project folder.

    Folder structure (.platform/nginx/conf.d/proxy.conf)

    .platform/
            nginx/
                conf.d/
                        proxy.conf
            00_myconf.config
    Content of File 1 - proxy.conf (Inside .platform/nginx/conf.d/ folder)

    client_max_body_size 50M;
    Content of File 2 - 00_myconf.config (Inside .platform/ folder)

    container_commands:
    01_reload_nginx:
        command: "service nginx reload"
    Care full with the extensions. First file is .conf and second file is .config.

    Now redeploy your project to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk and you will see the magic. This configuration will be added to all your EC2 instances, created as part of auto scaling.

    Detailed folder structure below.
